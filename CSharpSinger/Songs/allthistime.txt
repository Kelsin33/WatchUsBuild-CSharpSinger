Ten thousand seven hundred days:3000
 :1000
We've been accident free  :3000
 :800
Practice my confident face  :3000
 :800
My pod's depending on me  :3000
 :1000
Working hours fill the day  :3000
 :1000
Spending credits when we stay at home :3000

So long since anyone has seen :42
Out past the edge of our zone :42
One of the friendlier machines :42
Says I should leave it alone :42
But I wonder anyways :42
'Bout some things I shouldn't say :42
 :1
What if Kurzweil doesn't make it?  :42
What if all the switches get stuck on destroy? :42
When the shuttle goes we won't take it :42
And the final counter-measures are deployed :42
All we'll have is all this time :42
All we'll have is all this time :42
All this time :42
 :1
Reds for focus :42
Blues to not get upset :42
Wasters and complainers get what they get :42
All eyes watching no one's noticed me yet :42
 :1
I'll tell the secret if I speak :42
It's what I'm smiling about :42
I keep it tucked into my cheek :42
'Til it's safe to spit out :42
Things are stranger than they seem :42
Now I remember what I dream :42
 :1
What if Kurzweil doesn't make it? :42
What if all the switches get stuck on destroy? :42
When the shuttle goes we won't take it :42
And the final counter-measures are deployed :42
All we'll have is all this time :42
All we'll have is all this time :42
All we'll have is all this time :42
All this time  :42
