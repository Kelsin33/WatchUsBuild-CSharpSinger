Ten thousand seven hundred days :49
We've been accident free  :49
Practice my confident face  :49
My pod's depending on me  :49
Working hours fill the day  :49
Spending credits when we stay at home :49
 :1
So long since anyone has seen :49
Out past the edge of our zone :49
One of the friendlier machines :49
Says I should leave it alone :49
But I wonder anyways :49
'Bout some things I shouldn't say :49
 :1
What if Kurzweil doesn't make it?  :49
What if all the switches get stuck on destroy? :49
When the shuttle goes we won't take it :49
And the final counter-measures are deployed :49
All we'll have is all this time :49
All we'll have is all this time :49
All this time :49
 :1
Reds for focus :49
Blues to not get upset :49
Wasters and complainers get what they get :49
All eyes watching no one's noticed me yet :49
 :1
I'll tell the secret if I speak :49
It's what I'm smiling about :49
I keep it tucked into my cheek :49
'Til it's safe to spit out :49
Things are stranger than they seem :49
Now I remember what I dream :49
 :1
What if Kurzweil doesn't make it? :49
What if all the switches get stuck on destroy? :49
When the shuttle goes we won't take it :49
And the final counter-measures are deployed :49
All we'll have is all this time :49
All we'll have is all this time :49
All we'll have is all this time :49
All this time  :49
